<h1>html authoring</h1>
<p>javajosh <i>2023</i></p>

<p>
  I did not expect that developing a workable html authoring standard for myself would be necessary.
  The ability to use universally available tools (text editor, command line) and produce software is to be respected.
  Even if you generate html, these authoring standards will help.
  These standards also cover my preferred way to develop modules, described below.
</p>

<p>Browser api test harnesses</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="/svg">svg</a>
  <li><a href="/websockets">websockets</a>
  <li><a href="/wp">localstorage</a>
</ol>
<p>Custom module test harnesses</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="/core">core</a>
  <li><a href="/combine">combine</a>
  <li><a href="/stree3">stree</a>
  <li><a href="/friendly">friendly</a>
</ol>

<p>
  Each html file stands alone as a test harness for its corresponding component.
  core.md tests core.js, combine.html tests combine.js, etc.
  The file sources are themselves important, and designed to be read.
  Please consider the <i>page source</i> as an important part of the content.

<p>A brief description of what each does, from <code>readme.md</code>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Core.
    Handy functions that smooth over the JavaScript runtime.
    Comprehensive predicates/assertions.
  <li>Combine.
    The function used to produce a new state from a previous state plus an input.
    A generalization of <code>Object.assign()</code> and previously known as "<a href="https://github.com/javajosh/combine-keys">combineKeys</a>".
  <li>RTree.
    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">trie</a> data structure that organizes inputs into chains that result in different, related states.
    It is this structure that unifies previous distinct programming concepts like instantiation vs inheritance.
  <li>Friendly Function convention.
    A function takes a value and returns a result, possibly failing on bad values.
    A friendly function returns a description of which valid values are acceptable as a pattern.
  <li>(tentative) Normalized SVG coordinates.
    The basic authoring unit is the group ("g") containing a small number of path ("path") elts.
    Unique elements identified by string ID or by array id, which selects the Nth child recursively [3,5,11,0]
    Use a small, powerful side-effect primitive, <code>scatter(elt, obj)</code> which uses <code>elt.setAttribute(obj.key,
      obj.value)</code>.
  <li>(tentative) Board-game state convention.
    Express state only as updates to position of primitives, never creates or destroys elements.
    The state of the game is fully specified by the positions of the pieces on the board.
    A choice is a set of translations.
  <li>(ideas) html authoring; svg authoring; js binding to dom convention; 1+N process description convention; value key pair one value per line convention.
