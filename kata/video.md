## Testing embedding a local video.

What would it be like to self-host a video?
Let's use the [video element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video).
This was taken through win10 > logi capture, and it suffers from a sound and flicker problem:

<video controls height="500px" width="1000px">
  <source src="vids/2022-11-13_21-49-56.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
    <a href="vids/2022-11-13_21-49-56.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
  </p>
</video>
