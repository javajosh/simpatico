		// There is a universal render function that shows the target as an ordinary core, with a set of handlers, a residue, waiting for the next input.

		// We also support a "zoom out function" that allows us to visualize the universal core as the tail end of a line of messages. We can move back in time and *diverge*, creating a copy that differs at that moment in time. If our

	<!-- <p>This provides us with a novel way to distribute programs, as visible SVG files, with JSON embedded as an attribute of each element. The benefit, I suppose, is that at least the first reduction can be skipped on startup (organization into an n-arry tree). The second reduction (producing a residue at each point in the tree) is very expensive to do statelessly. So we optimize a little bit by storing a few important residues, and interesting you can store them with their visualizations, too!</p>

	<h1>Everything's a move</h1>
	<p>The Simpaticore is a very general piece of software. Your browser when it first touches a simpaticore enabled client, installs a durable process simpaticore. This client simpaticore wakes and sleeps, and is sensitive to user input. User input is combined into messages which are passed into the core, which may reject it (in which case the core is unaffected), or it is accepted and the core changed in some way to reflect the input.</p>

	<p>You will have a single simpaticore for you. For yourself. The core hosts unique content made within the core, but it can also model and mediate for other applications. You can model the relationships that matter to you most, and make sure they're working.</p>

	God, if he exists, has not taken a strong interest in us.
	Science is real. Gravity causes fusion that brightens our planet. Plants fuse sunlight with air, soil and water, to produce miraculous objects, delicious and bountiful foods.

	People are often terrible. They are cruel, greedy, ignorant, bitter, biting, vain, lustful, arrogant creatures. They sin without knowing; they know and they don't care. They do not fear to sin anymore. But they are not uniformly so, either in time or across individuals. And some families seem calmer than others, more wise, more favored by fate, somehow. 

	God is a miracle, because with faith in God we save each other from sin. We help reinforce a father that is good because it encourages you in the delusion that a man in the sky is watching, caring for you but also judging, and that if you make the wrong call it might cost you dearly.

	<p>Curiosity voyage. End of the community garden project. Two weddings same weekend, wanted to look at other community gardens projects. Burlington Vermont has a famous community garden. Couch surfing, met So as the roommate of a couch surfing host, Summer 2008.</p>

	<p>About to move to farm with Brian and Kristen, Fall 2008. You start farming in the fall in Florida, and stop in the following Spring. She worked from Fall to Spring, May 2009. And then took a farm internship May, 2009, in Vermont, together. Killed many chickens, raised three sheep and killed them. Taught chease making classes. Grew a tone of veggies. Working for Hope Roots Farm. A strange little farm, experience was really strange. A marginal farm on the Conneticut river; good bottom land that had been robbed of it's topsoil. Scraped the topsoil before selling. Bianca and her mom. Bianca social worker, at risk teens. 3 girls who didn't want to get dirty. Corey was a machine - but not sustainable. </p>

	<p>If we want wisdom to have power it is time to accept wisdom that seeks power. Men's power comes from their position in a power structure, a hierarchy which takes its direction from the top. A business leader, a CEO, occupies this position in the structure of society, part of the intricate connections between indvidual consumers, businesses, all in a tangle until real resources are acquired from the Earth.</p>

	<p>What words do I have for you? None but the truth.</p>
	<p>The sun shines on this great ball of our planet, and life has formed, the only one we know of in the universe, and we each are part of it.</p>
	<p>And yet we spread, and get better at spreading and supporting more of our numbers through extracting resources. We destroy some large fraction of bio-diversity on the planet. We dismantle our life-support system (the vast majority of life itself).</p>

	<p>And in fact I would argue that life itself, in all it's forms, is valuable information, the output of a billions-year long computation taking place in the fullness of our 3-D universe taking place at many levels of zoom. But mainly we care about nano-systems, around the cell level. This is the first time you cross the barrier from 'life' to 'not life'. But the real cells you see might be highly specialized, and part of a collaborating group of cells, we would call "organism". The behavior of these organisms is described in part by understanding the functioning of its cells; however there are behaviors that cannot be explained in this way. In particular, learned behaviors. Learning can be as simple as mimicing a body motion - this demands a certain amount of computation, to recognize that your form is similar to another, and attempt to move your form in the way that you see. Learning can be harder to define, as with language and math - roughly, the art of giving the right responses to questions considered difficult by society.</p>

	<p>A good leader would select the right, or at least justifiable, decision from a list of options. A great leader might know when to take a risky decision; but a terrible, failed leader would become so for the same reason.</p>

	<p>The human organism is interesting because of how message-heavy it has become. Our mundane daily lives seems dominated by structured message passing. Paperwork, requested, recieved, in process of being filled out, sent. Bills are messages. Terms of service updates are messages. Changes to the the payment instructions. Applications for insurance. Applying for a claim. (And government services can be modelled as insurance, with benefits coming as the result of a claims process). Participation in markets, including the job market, second-hand thing market, or whatever market your business is in.</p>

	<p>Curiously, so much of this has been automated, in a sense. The webapp that sits between us and our accounts! The blessing and curse of our age. And an unnecessary usability hurdle, not to mention market-destroying friction. But the path to a better way must support the old way! In this case, we can reverse engineer the webapp and extract our total degrees of freedom, including anticipating later stage questions. Using this (real) information we can build a (real) checklist for the person actually getting through the process. It would be helpful to see what a successful traversal looks like, and what the common failures are.</p>

	<p>Part of your amunition are the documents you already have. Every document exists in the context of a relationship, which often takes the form of an account. (This is a particularly useful formulation of document in a heavily SaaS hosted world.)</p>

	<p>Messages about things. Dealing with problems. Fighting decay. Achieving goals. (repair a node, improve a node, sell a node, recycle a node, buy a node) Improving the home. Find, get, keep a steady job. Replace the job with invention or business income. Buy a ranch in a rainy area. Take care of mental health issues.</p>

	<p>Some relationships are in tension, meaning there is work to do in them. IN some relationships, "tension" is easy to spot, unmistakable. They send a late notice. They report you to a credit agency. They evict you. They fire you. (Those last three are basically broken relationships, but warnings are tension, too.) You creating tension is deciding to improve the living room with some new art. Or confronting the land lord about not repairing the apartment.</p>

	<p>Or, if you're unemployed, doing everything you can to secure funding for the family.</p>

	<p>I don't mind working hard. What I offer is a way of thinking about communications. To understand and improve your message-making to maintain stronger, healthier relationships with everyone in your life, whether it involves money or the heart.</p>

	<p>Sending, and reacting to, messages. One can imagine a puppet show, where interaction between puppets is simulated; there is a nice computerized version of this, which is a scene that is controlled continuously by a human. Every input causes motion, and there is no interdependence. But we can simulate this! We zoom out, clone, optionally modify, move into collision position, and then...make your modifications! I think of it a little like stop-motion animation, especially popular with clay (claymation).</p>

	<p>Like all programs there is a part that doesn't change. A simple HTML file with one major javascript function, that registers for a good solid list of input events. Subsequent input is generally made, and saved, in the browser (although you can save it in a file too). We can imagine a program that lives in localStorage, and is loaded when you access the site.</p>

	<p>Low level inputs are gathered automatically, but nothing will happen until we react to them. The simpatico way of reacting is to define a handler. The top-level handler sees all events, and handles interception of special navigation commands, especially zoom in and zoom out. Other commands are expected to follow the basic UX convention, which is that focus follows the mouse (or finger), is sticky to the object, and the canonical input is the keyboard.</p>

	<p></p> -->
