<h1>Simpatico</h1>
<p>javajosh <i>2023</i></p>

<p>
  <i>Site status:</i> unreleased tech demo.
  Non-technical, non-learner users will find very little to interest them, currently.
  Advanced technical users will be interested in the <a href="https://github.com/javajosh/simpatico">github code</a>.
  The <a href="/kata/">browser kata</a> serve as a good reference for browser capabilities.
  A good adjunct to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> and other good internet resources.
</p>

<p>
  There are proof-of-concept, early versions of end-user apps.
  An extremely simple <a href="/wp">word processor</a>.
  This is a tiny word processor in an html file that uses <code>contenteditable</code> and <code>localstorage</code> as if it was a little filesystem.
  Your "document" never leaves your browser.
  A simple <a href="/chat">chat client</a>.
  This is also a single, tiny html file that lets you send strings anyone else on the site.
  A primoridal browser hosted <a href="/db/">database</a> in the same style.
</p>

<p>
  More pressing is my desire to <i>visualize</i> a novel data-structure and algorithm that I have high hopes for.
  The <a href="/stree">stree</a> is a very useful data-structure for modeling many important application problems.
  Comfort with <a href="/kata/svg">svg</a> and animation is useful for making visualizations.
  We build up to that with <a href="kata/svg-events">svg events</a>.
  We also explore the browser's dynamic interpretation of svg with <a href="/demos/svg-compose">svg-compose</a>.
  Now there are <a href="/kata/acceptance.html">acceptance tests</a>.
  There is also a <a href="/crypto">crypto</a> kata (that became a library).
