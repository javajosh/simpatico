  Simpatico is for you.
  One measure of the success of a system is how much value someone can create with it.
</p>
<p>
  How about a simple <a href="/wp">word processor</a>?
  This is a tiny html file that lets you edit localstorage as if it was a little filesystem.
  It is a good demonstration of <a href="/html">html authoring standard</a> and the power of focusing your work.
</p>
<p>
  A simple <a href="/chat">chat client</a>.
  This is also a single, tiny html file that lets you send strings to everyone connected.
  This is a good example of using simple <a href="/crypto">browser crypto</a> to do a good job of hiding data.
  (Please don't abuse this one).
</p>
<p>
  Eventually I'd like to try my hand at building a <a href="/db">visual database</a> in the same style.
  Start with sqlite in wasm using the new browser file api as a foundation.
</p>
<p>
  More pressing is my desire to <i>visualize</i> a novel data-structure and algorithm that I have high hopes for.
  The <a href="rtree.html">rtree</a> is a very useful data-structure for modeling many important application problems.
  Comfort with <a href="svg.html">svg</a> and animation is useful for making visualizations.
  We build up to that with <a href="svg-events.html">svg events</a>.
  We also explore the browser's dynamic interpretation of svg with <a href="svg-compose.html">svg-compose</a>
