<h1>Simpatico</h1>
<p>Josh Rehman <i>2022</i></p>

<p>
  Hi! If you're reading this in a browser with a localhost URL, congrats!
  You probably got here by doing something like this:
</p>

<pre>
  $ git clone https://github.com/javajosh/simpatico.git && cd simpatico
  $ npm run serve
  [open chrome with localhost address]
</pre>

<p>
  You are now looking at this file, <code>simpatico/index.html</code>.
  <i>ctrl-click</i> on the links below to open them in new tabs.
  (You can also look at them one by one.)
  Here they are, roughly in order of their dependencies:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="core.html">core</a>
  <li><a href="combine.html">combine</a>
  <li><a href="rtree.html">rtree</a>
  <li><a href="friendly.html">friendly</a>
</ol>

<p>
  Each html file stands alone as a test harness for its corresponding component. core.html tests core.js, combine.html tests combine.js, and so on.
  The file sources are themselves important, and designed to be read.
  Over time, I anticipate adding more descriptive content that don't require reading the source, but for now please consider the page source as an important part of the content.
</p>

<p>A brief description of what each does, from <code>readme.md</code>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Core. Very generic, convenience functions that smooth over the JavaScript runtime.
    Of particular importance is the definition of a comprehensive set of predicates/assertions.
  <li>Combine. The function used to produce a new state from a previous state plus an input.
    A generalization of <code>Object.assign()</code> and previously known as "<a href="https://github.com/javajosh/combine-keys">combineKeys</a>".
  <li>RTree. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">trie</a> data structure that organizes inputs into chains that result in different, related states.
    It is this structure that unifies previous distinct concepts like instantiation vs inheritance, and also provides natural "collections" support.
  <li>Friendly. A very simple runtime type checking system. The goal is to make strange functions easier to call!
</ol>
