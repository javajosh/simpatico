<h1>Simpatico</h1>
<p>javajosh <i>2023</i></p>

<p><i>Site status:</i> tech demo.</p>

<p>
  Non-technical, non-learner users will find very little to interest them, currently.
</p>

<p>
  Advanced technical users will be interested in the <a href="https://github.com/javajosh/simpatico">github code</a>.
  They may also be interested in Simpatico's <a href="/ideas">motivating ideas</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="/kata">browser kata</a> serve as a good reference for browser capabilities.
  A good adjunct to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> and other good internet resources.
</p>

<h2>Early apps</h2>
<p>
  An extremely simple <a href="/wp">word processor</a>.
  This is a tiny word processor in an html file that uses <code>contenteditable</code> and <code>localstorage</code> as if it was a little filesystem.
  Your "document" never leaves your browser.
</p>
<p>
  A simple <a href="/chat">chat client</a>.
  This is also a single, tiny html file that lets you send strings anyone else on the site.
</p>
<p>
  A primoridal browser hosted <a href="/db/index.html">database</a> in the same style.
</p>
<p>
  More pressing is my desire to <i>visualize</i> a novel data-structure and algorithm that I have high hopes for.
  The <a href="stree.html">rtree</a> is a very useful data-structure for modeling many important application problems.
  Comfort with <a href="svg.html">svg</a> and animation is useful for making visualizations.
  We build up to that with <a href="svg-events.html">svg events</a>.
  We also explore the browser's dynamic interpretation of svg with <a href="svg-compose.html">svg-compose</a>
