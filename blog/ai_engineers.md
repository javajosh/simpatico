# AI Engineers
Will the only software engineers be AI engineers?
I think the answer is a resounding no. We will use AI to build our applications, and we'll get better at it.
It may be that AI software engineering agents will be good at building applications.
But it's not clear that AI will ever have the enornous context window that humans have.
Certainly its not the case today; AI is good at helping with tactical problems, but terrible at strategic ones.
AI is impotent when it comes to judgement - AI cannot tell if something is good or bad.
AI can't reason, and it can't reason about high-level issues like data-flow.
It doesn't have a coherent mental model about system design.

What it does well is, once you know what you want to build and how to build it, it can help you get it done.
This is very valuable, but it's not the whole picture.
