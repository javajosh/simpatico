# Games and Music
The speed and precision of a musician are very similar to the speed and precision required by certain games like Rocket League.
The pleasure of learning how to do the tricky parts of a musical piece or a tricky game interaction are very similar.
I imagine that fighting games are similar, although I've never liked fighting games enough to find out.

Real-time strategy games, like Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, have a similar but different trade-off.
These are like small bottle civilizations, sped-up and managed by the player making trade-offs for short, medium, and long term goals.
Plans come to fruition at different times for each player, and then interact in chaotic ways.
No doubt for top players the hand-eye coordination problem is similar to that of music/rocket league, but I've never gotten good enough at RTS to feel that.
