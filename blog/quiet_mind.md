# Quiet mind
The best resource a software programmer can have is a quiet mind.
Intrusive, distracting thoughts are a liability.
One can make use of them, occasionally, but a quiet mind is far more powerful when working with code.
One's quiet mind patiently waits and listens and performs actions in a vaccum that allows for careful assessment.

In contrast, the noisy mind is distracted, is talking while waiting, and is not listening.
When it performs an action it is doing so from a place of uncertainty, anxiety.
The actions can pile on top of each other in a chaotic way.

Sources worry and anxiety run the gamut from personal things, global things, and even things about the software that you're not currently considering.
The first two are obvious, the third is more incidious because it's *close* to the problem-at-hand.
These are the structural weaknesses of the code - the architecture, the build systems, etc.
This can also be relatively superficial things like code formatting and (lack of) comments.
It can be a struggle to simply accept certain things as given, even when they are, like everything else in software, constructed and mutable.
