# My favorite SVG stuff in One Codepen

*Goal*: write simple, pedagogical examples of all of the useful parts of SVG. (Basically I always forget the syntax.)

<svg id="svg1" width="100" height="100" viewport="0 0 100 100" style="border:1px solid black">
    <rect x=20 y=20 height="20" width="20" fill="green" />
</svg> 

## Requirements
  1. Easy to read.
  2. Leave out any unnecessary stuff, like name-spaces.
  3. Show all the common shapes.
  4. Show how to modify common properties and attributes in JavaScript.
  4. Be 'web verite' minimalist: no build, enough CSS to make the text look not ugly, load resources locally (in my case you're accessing at least CodePen.io, CloudFlare, and possibly GitHub.)
