<p>This is the <i>test harness</i> for Simpatico. Like all of Simpatico, this artifact is first and foremost a practical
  tool. In fact, it's a tool that will grow with Simpatico as I complete it.</p>

<p class="sidenote">As a by now well seasoned web developer, I've learned a thing or two about how web pages are built in a
  "professional" context, and I have to admit: it's not pretty. In particular, the browser itself is a mess. And the
  reason? The browser is at the top of the food chain, in terms of software, but it's being fed into from an enormous
  variety of places, often very late in the lifetime of the tab. "Living in" the browser long-term is a relatively
  new movement in web app development, and one which I think has legs! I will say that I really like web programs, like
  this one, that are HTML files written in a text editor, and which are small and very simply constructed. It's a good
  start for any ambitious program.</p>

<p>This tab runs a test. This test will change the favicon different colors depending on the outcome of this test. We
  say precisely that the test consists of setting the initial favicon, and then setting it to green if "successful", and
  red if there's a failure. The code that runs before that final statement is "test code".

<p class="sidenote">
  HTML is a kind of declarative data-structure that is <i>okay</i> to tightly couple to any programming statements you
  may write.
  (This is why I like to quickly declare handy js references to the DOM at the very beginning of the code section.)
</p>

<p>Because our browser space is so clean and nice, we can breathe.
  The browser is coming into contact with each line as you write it.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">Sadly the nature of markup languages means there is always a dangling closing bit that means adding
  things is going to involve more than concatenation</p>

<p>It allows us to do what people so rarely do these days, which is have fun with <span
  id="s0">the browser medium</span>.</p>

<!--  The use of modules allows me to isolate scripts on the page from each other-->
<!--  and code in a more natural way. It does make REPL interaction harder, however.-->
<script type="module">
  // s stands for "span". increment these s0 numbers over time
  // The tag is useful for giving context to the elt;
  const span = document.querySelector("span#s0");

  const ms = 1, Hz = 1, pi = Math.PI; // Show units in code!
  const rotPeriod = 4000 * ms; // desired rotational period
  const tp = 17 * ms; // desired tick period
  const timeOut = 2 * rotPeriod;

  const theta_at_t = (t = (Date.now() - started)) => (2 * pi * t) / (rotPeriod);
  const draw = () => span.setAttribute('style', `position: absolute; transform: rotate(${theta_at_t()}rad`);

<p>Let there be a green circle in motion on a normalized coordinate system:</p>

  <!-- The viewbox is centered on 0,0 with just enough space to inscribe an r=1 unit circle -->
  <!-- scale(1,-1) flips the y-axis so that positive y values move up, as God intended. -->
  <g transform="scale(1,-1)">
    <!-- This small SVG authoring convention of my own invention includes omitting quotes for dynamic-ish attr values   -->
    <!-- These initial lines of SVG are specifically diagnostic  -->
    <line class="x-axis-blue" stroke="blue" stroke-width=.001 x1=-1 y1=0  x2=1 y2=0 />
    <line class="y-axis-red"  stroke="red"  stroke-width=.001 x1=0  y1=-1 x2=0 y2=1 />

    <!-- These help orient us by translating in one known direction, which is the varying attribute. -->
    <circle class="red-y"  fill="red"  cx=.0  cy=.5 r=.05 />
    <circle class="blue-x" fill="blue" cx=.5  cy=.0 r=.05 />

    <!-- This is the element we'll be moving, the expression of degrees of freedom -->
    <g id="s2-transform" class="transform" >
      <circle id="s2" class="green-circle" fill="none" stroke="green" stroke-width=".01"  cx=0 cy=0 r=.05 />

    <!-- SVG does not directly support vectors with arrows, sadly. See, for example: http://www.cheat-sheets.org/own/svg/index.xhtml#vector for how to do it, but its very bulky. -->
  </g>

<p class="sidenote">The value of normalized units is considerable. Consider that as we enter digits of a number after the decimal, we are always becoming more precise, and not invalidating the previous numbers. Our number system encourages us to to stop just short of any goal, and then move toward it cautiously. When you add numbers in front of the decimal, each number changes the meanings of the ones before. This is in part why numbers are right aligned, because your digits "push" the other digits to the left. The present is constantly modifying the past, and by a factor of 10! Horrible! I don't think it's odd to wonder what the bounds are on your life and work - what does 1.0 mean for you?</p>

<script type="module">
  // Now that we're oriented, lets move the green circle around.
  // We'll do it in two ways

  const combine = (elt, obj) => {
    if (elt.tagName === "circle") Object.assign(obj, {cx:obj.x, cy:obj.y}); // Support (x,y) -> (cx, cy) for circles

<p class="sidenote">There are two ways to move an SVG elt, with attributes and a g transform. By convention we reserve the first kind of motion for "drawing a symbol" and the second kind of motion for "moving a symbol". Consider the contrast:
  <pre><code>  const vec = {x: -.25, y: -.25};
  combine(s2, vec);
  combine(s3, {transform: `translate(${vec.x},${vec.y})`});
</code></pre>

<p class="questions">
  <ol>
    <li>How many iterations does it take, on average, for the circle to leave the viewport?
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>Errata</h3>
<p>Unfortunately,</p>
<p>The idea so far is to highlight what the browser can do without library support. This counts as "minimalism" these days! However, these "naive" solutions tend to fall down in real life. In particular, we have no abstraction for a "particle" and so no real way to talk about a "system of particles", each of which may interact. One thing it may be worth talking about is *why* this is important, and how this complexity rears its head in real applications. For example, we still see the "1+N" structure in these simple examples - but which parts of these examples tend to grow in complexity?</p>

<h2>Multiple Particles</h2>

<p>The key here is to leverage software's super-power, which is copying complexity without error. First step is to make a particle in an Rtree, then make it sensitive to ticks. Then introduce code to render the particle (or the entire RTree - not sure yet.</p>

<script type="module">
  import * as RTree from './rtree.js';

  const {rtree} = RTree;

<!--	<h2>Simpatico</h2>-->

<!--  <p>Simpatico is easiest to understand if you understand the ideas behind <a href="react redux">Redux</a>, namely the idea that you can (and <i>should</i>!) model your application state as a monolithic object which is rendered into the current browser state by the pure functions of your UI. A straightforward idea, but complexity arises, and not just because of performance issues. It turns out that writing that function is a challenge, although JSX helps by allowing you to more cleanly write components that are explicit about taking state and rendering it.</p>-->

<!--	<p>Simpatico is improved state management for browser applications. However, the ideas within it generalize across other domains. Simpatico models the running process as a tree of "cores" that are rooted at the physical level, with one long-lived global object, the global core. This core is made "sensitive" to the outside world via a singular S() method. It always starts at {} and on startup we proceed. By convention we allow row 0 in the rtree to represent the initial startup of the process, delegating most if not all further change to branches.</p>-->

<!--  <p>Combined with a good visualization, the S() method can help you explore your design space, to characterize in a precise way the state-space of your application. Although cores can be used to accumulate and process low-level measurement, they can also be used to accumulate higher level messages into overall application state. The former corresponds to UI componentry, whereas the latter corresponds to server componentry.</p>-->
