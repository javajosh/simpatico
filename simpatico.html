<h1>Simpatico.js</h1>

<p>This is the <i>test harness</i> for Simpatico. Like all of Simpatico, this artifact is first and foremost a practical
  tool. In fact, it's a tool that will grow with Simpatico as I complete it.</p>

<p class="sidenote">As a by now well seasoned web developer, I've learned a thing or two about how web pages are built in a
  "professional" context, and I have to admit: it's not pretty. In particular, the browser itself is a mess. And the
  reason? The browser is at the top of the food chain, in terms of software, but it's being fed into from an enormous
  variety of places, often very late in the lifetime of the tab. "Living in" the browser long-term is a relatively
  new movement in web app development, and one which I think has legs! I will say that I really like web programs, like
  this one, that are HTML files written in a text editor, and which are small and very simply constructed. It's a good
  start for any ambitious program.</p>

<p>This tab runs a test. This test will change the favicon different colors depending on the outcome of this test. We
  say precisely that the test consists of setting the initial favicon, and then setting it to green if "successful", and
  red if there's a failure. The code that runs before that final statement is "test code".

<p class="sidenote">
  HTML is a kind of declarative data-structure that is <i>okay</i> to tightly couple to any programming statements you
  may write.
  (This is why I like to quickly declare handy js references to the DOM at the very beginning of the code section.)
</p>

<p>Because our browser space is so clean and nice, we can breathe.
  The browser is coming into contact with each line as you write it.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">Sadly the nature of markup languages means there is always a dangling closing bit that means adding
  things is going to involve more than concatenation</p>

<p>It allows us to do what people so rarely do these days, which is have fun with <span
  id="s0">the browser medium</span>.</p>

<!--  The use of modules allows me to isolate scripts on the page from each other-->
<!--  and code in a more natural way. It does make REPL interaction harder, however.-->
<script id="m0" type="module">
  // s stands for "span", m for "module". increment these numbers over time
  // The tag is unnecessary but useful for giving context to the code
  const s0 = document.querySelector("span#s0");
  const ms = 1, Hz = 1, pi = Math.PI; // Show units in code!
  const rotPeriod = 4000 * ms; // desired rotational period
  const tp = 17 * ms; // desired tick period
  const timeOut = 2 * rotPeriod;

  const theta_at_t = (t = Date.now() - started) => (2 * pi * t) / (rotPeriod);
  const write = () => s0.setAttribute('style',
    `position: absolute; transform: rotate(${theta_at_t()}rad`
  );

  let running = true, started = Date.now();
  s0.addEventListener('click', e => {
    running = !running
  });
  setInterval(() => {
    if (running && (Date.now() < (started + timeOut)))
      write();
  }, tp);
</script>

<p>Let there be a green square in motion on a normalized coordinate system:</p>

<svg id="s1" width="200" height="200" style="border: solid gray 1px" viewbox="-1,-1 2,2">
  <!-- The viewbox is centered on 0,0 with just enough space to inscribe an r=1 unit circle -->
  <!-- scale(-1,1) flips the y-axis so that positive y values move up, as God intended. -->
  <g transform="scale(-1,1)">
    <line class="x-axis" x1=-1 y1=0 x2=1 y2=0 stroke=blue stroke-width=.001 />
    <line class="y-axis" x1=0 y1=-1 x2=0 y2=1 stroke=blue stroke-width=.001 />

    <!-- These help orient us by translating in one known direction. -->
    <rect class="blue-y" x=-.05 y=-.5 width=0.1 height=0.1 fill=blue />
    <rect class="red-x" x=-.5 y=-.05 width=0.1 height=0.1 fill=red />

    <!-- This is the element we'll be moving, the expression of degrees of freedom -->
    <g id="s2-transform">
      <rect class="green-square" x=-.05 y=-.05 width=0.1 height=0.1 fill=green id="s2" />
    </g>

    <!-- SVG does not directly support vectors with arrows, sadly. See, for example: http://www.cheat-sheets.org/own/svg/index.xhtml#vector -->
  </g>
</svg>

<p class="sidenote">The value of normalized units is considerable. Consider that as we enter digits of a number after the decimal, we are always becoming more precise, and not invalidating the previous numbers. Our number system encourages us to to stop just short of any goal, and then move toward it cautiously. When you add numbers in front of the decimal, each number changes the meanings of the ones before. This is in part why numbers are right aligned, because your digits "push" the other digits to the left. The present is constantly modifying the past, and by a factor of 10! Horrible! I don't think it's odd to wonder what the bounds are on your life and work - what does 1.0 mean for you?</p>

<script type="module">
  // Now that we're oriented, lets move the green square around.

  // Q: How would you allow the square to slow down?
  // Q: How could you make it a random walk? (Generators?)
  // Q: (For the teachers) is it valuable to mention requestAnimationFrame() as a better alternative to setInterval, even though it has nothing to do with the topic at hand?
  // Q: How many iterations does it take, on average, for the square to leave the viewport?
  // Q: How much faster does this simulation run "headless", without animation?
  // Q: Which function is being called the most? How often?

<!--	<h2>Simpatico</h2>-->

<!--  <p>Simpatico is easiest to understand if you understand the ideas behind <a href="react redux">Redux</a>, namely the idea that you can (and <i>should</i>!) model your application state as a monolithic object which is rendered into the current browser state by the pure functions of your UI. A straightforward idea, but complexity arises, and not just because of performance issues. It turns out that writing that function is a challenge, although JSX helps by allowing you to more cleanly write components that are explicit about taking state and rendering it.</p>-->

<!--	<p>Simpatico is improved state management for browser applications. However, the ideas within it generalize across other domains. Simpatico models the running process as a tree of "cores" that are rooted at the physical level, with one long-lived global object, the global core. This core is made "sensitive" to the outside world via a singular S() method. It always starts at {} and on startup we proceed. By convention we allow row 0 in the rtree to represent the initial startup of the process, delegating most if not all further change to branches.</p>-->

<!--  <p>Combined with a good visualization, the S() method can help you explore your design space, to characterize in a precise way the state-space of your application. Although cores can be used to accumulate and process low-level measurement, they can also be used to accumulate higher level messages into overall application state. The former corresponds to UI componentry, whereas the latter corresponds to server componentry.</p>-->
