<h3>Literate</h3>
<p>Simpatico is fundamentally "literate" because it's embedded in the same HTML your programs are running in. However we will take care
to make it easy to distinguish between static html elements we need to reference in our programs, and free-form content like this.</p>
<h3>Testable</h3>
<p>Testable means that if an error is thrown that the favicon and background turn red. Every component needs to load and run without error.</p>

<h3>Opinionated</h3>
<p>A component is some dom and some code that binds to that dom. Simpatico tends to prefer low-entropy object representations
that are rendered using a low-entropy visual representation (SVG), and as a set of related specializations of something common.
SVG for data entry isn't that intimidating, it just sounds tedious but it may just be something to get through.</p>
<p>The intuition is to think through the svg objects you might want to draw an object. Key value pairs, arranged in 2-dimensions.
And then also decide on how to represent nested objects. In fact you are defining an n-arry trie, with a value at each list of strings.</p>
<p>Next, you imagine that you always build up more complex objects from simpler ones. You also can define special locations
called "call points" which are rows with available degrees of freedom. I am a fan of both really simple, static concrete
images, but also of the functional style, so we will also give a characterization that way. A program is considered the state
acquired after integrating some ordered set of inputs. We can normalize and simplify the integration using something like the combine
function. The combine function, meanwhile, allows for a version of function invocation, when you send in an object of a certain shape.</p>
<p>In all cases we treat the process-level rtree singleton specially, and store a version of it in localstorage.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The canonical visualization is a rehman tree, but you can get there starting with events dropping from pipes and collected somewhere.
The collections are best modelled as rows in a (relatively ephemeral) rtree.</p>

<p>This tab runs a test. This test will change the favicon different colors depending on the outcome of this test.
  We say precisely that the test consists of setting the initial favicon, and then setting it to green if "successful", and red if there's a failure.</p>

<p>Because our browser space is so clean and nice, we can breathe. The browser is coming into contact with each line as you write it.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The value of normalized units is considerable. Consider that as we enter digits of a number after the decimal, we are always becoming more precise, and not invalidating the previous numbers. Our number system encourages us to to stop just short of any goal, and then move toward it cautiously. When you add numbers in front of the decimal, each number changes the meanings of the ones before. This is in part why numbers are right aligned, because your digits "push" the other digits to the left. The present is constantly modifying the past, and by a factor of 10! Horrible! I don't think it's odd to wonder what the bounds are on your life and work - what does 1.0 mean for you?</p>

<p class="sidenote">There are two ways to move an SVG elt, with attributes and a g transform. By convention we reserve the first kind of motion for "drawing a symbol" and the second kind of motion for "moving a symbol". Consider the contrast:

  combine(s2, vec);
  combine(s3, {transform: `translate(${vec.x},${vec.y})`});

    <li>How many iterations does it take, on average, for the circle to leave the viewport?

<h3>Errata</h3>
<p>Unfortunately,</p>
<p>The idea so far is to highlight what the browser can do without library support. This counts as "minimalism" these days! However, these "naive" solutions tend to fall down in real life. In particular, we have no abstraction for a "particle" and so no real way to talk about a "system of particles", each of which may interact. One thing it may be worth talking about is *why* this is important, and how this complexity rears its head in real applications. For example, we still see the "1+N" structure in these simple examples - but which parts of these examples tend to grow in complexity?</p>

<h2>Multiple Particles</h2>

<p>The key here is to leverage software's super-power, which is copying complexity without error. First step is to make a particle in an Rtree, then make it sensitive to ticks. Then introduce code to render the particle (or the entire RTree - not sure yet.</p>

<script type="module">
  import * as RTree from './rtree.js';
  const {rtree} = RTree;
</script>

    <p class="sidenote">This marks the first use of an <code>import</code> statement in the body of this document. It adds a subresource dependency.</p>


<!--	<h2>Simpatico</h2>-->

<!--  <p>Simpatico is easiest to understand if you understand the ideas behind <a href="react redux">Redux</a>, namely the idea that you can (and <i>should</i>!) model your application state as a monolithic object which is rendered into the current browser state by the pure functions of your UI. A straightforward idea, but complexity arises, and not just because of performance issues. It turns out that writing that function is a challenge, although JSX helps by allowing you to more cleanly write components that are explicit about taking state and rendering it.</p>-->

<!--	<p>Simpatico is improved state management for browser applications. However, the ideas within it generalize across other domains. Simpatico models the running process as a tree of "cores" that are rooted at the physical level, with one long-lived global object, the global core. This core is made "sensitive" to the outside world via a singular S() method. It always starts at {} and on startup we proceed. By convention we allow row 0 in the rtree to represent the initial startup of the process, delegating most if not all further change to branches.</p>-->

<!--  <p>Combined with a good visualization, the S() method can help you explore your design space, to characterize in a precise way the state-space of your application. Although cores can be used to accumulate and process low-level measurement, they can also be used to accumulate higher level messages into overall application state. The former corresponds to UI componentry, whereas the latter corresponds to server componentry.</p>-->

<h2>Testing embedding a local video.</h2>
<p>
  What would it be like to self-host a video?
  Let's use the [video element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video).
  This was taken through win10 > logi capture, and it suffers from a sound and flicker problem:
</p>

<video controls height="500px" width="1000px">
  <source src="vids/2022-11-13_21-49-56.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
    <a href="vids/2022-11-13_21-49-56.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
  </p>
</video>

<p>
  This video is taken with win10 > OBS and it's of generally higher quality, but it's a little harder to use.
