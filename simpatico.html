  <p class="sidenote">
    The value of normalized units is considerable.
    Consider that as we enter digits of a number after the decimal, we are always becoming more precise, and not invalidating the previous numbers.
    Our number system encourages us to to stop just short of any goal, and then move toward it cautiously.
    When you add numbers in front of the decimal, each number changes the meanings of the ones before.
    This is in part why numbers are right aligned, because your digits "push" the other digits to the left.
    The present is constantly modifying the past, and by a factor of 10! Horrible!

  <h3>Simpatico and Redux</h3>

  <p>Simpatico is easiest to understand if you understand the ideas behind <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>.
  namely the idea that you can (and <i>should</i>!) model your application state as a monolithic object which is rendered into the current browser state by the pure functions of your UI.
  A straightforward idea, but complexity arises, and not just because of performance issues.
  It turns out that writing that function is a challenge, although JSX helps by allowing you to more cleanly write components that are explicit about taking state and rendering it.

  <p>Simpatico is improved state management for browser applications.
  However, the ideas within it generalize across other domains.
  Simpatico models the running process as a tree of "cores" that are rooted at the physical level, with one long-lived global object, the global core.
  This core is made "sensitive" to the outside world via a singular S() method.
  It always starts at {} and on startup we proceed.
  By convention we allow row 0 in the stree to represent the initial startup of the process, delegating most if not all further change to branches.

  <p>Combined with a good visualization, the S() method can help you explore your design space, to characterize in a precise way the state-space of your application.
  Although cores can be used to accumulate and process low-level measurement, they can also be used to accumulate higher level messages into overall application state.
  The former corresponds to UI componentry, whereas the latter corresponds to server componentry.
