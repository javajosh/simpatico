# Simpatico

*Site status:* unreleased tech demo.
Non-technical, non-learner users will find very little to interest them, currently.
Advanced technical users will be interested in the [github code](https://github.com/javajosh/simpatico).

One way to go from one to the other is to read [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/), and do the exercises.

In other words, this site and its contents is [under construction](http://textfiles.com/underconstruction/)!

  1.  [Interaction to Next Paint (INP)](https://web.dev/inp/) - A new
    metrics API to measure how slow a page is. Simpatico obviates this
    by not being huge, and having miniamlist libraries. #complexity
  1.  [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) a jupyter distribution with some
    added value. Similar in goal to [literate markdown](lit.md) #similar
