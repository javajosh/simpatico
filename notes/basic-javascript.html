<p>ES6. Objects, functions. Prototypal inheritance.</p>

<script>


    // This demonstrates prototypal inheritance.
    let a = {a:1, b:2};
    let b = {c:3, d:4};
    let c = {e:5, f:6};

    // A primitive combine() (only supports non-reactive, destructive key-merge)
    // But it has the essential feature of reifying our state and our input, and shows
    // the mutable-state pattern. d is mutated as a side-effect
    let d = {};
    Object.assign(d, a);
    Object.assign(d, b);
    Object.assign(d, c);

    // By contrast, an immutable-state pattern looks like this. The value of e is never changed,
    // but e is a mutable reference that points to a succession of values. If you squint your eyes
    // you see that each state has a fresh allocation (the empty object at the beginning of the assign call).
    let e = {};
    e = Object.assign({}, e, a);
    e = Object.assign({}, e, b);
    e = Object.assign({}, e, c);

    // The elements of assign can be computed.
    let f = (e,a) => ({a: e.a + a.a});
    e = Object.assign({}, e, f(e,a));
    e = Object.assign({}, e, f(e,a), f(e,b), f(e,c));

    // Compute all inputs independently
    [a,b,c].map(input => f(e, input));

    // Compute all inputs dependently, mutating e
    [a,b,c].reduce(f, e);
    [e,a,b,c].reduce(f, {});




    // Compute inputs dependently, without mutating e

    //Generalization to summing any property
//    let g = (a, b, p) => {
//      let result = Object.assign({}, a);
//      result[p] =  (a[p] || 0) + (b[p]||0);
//      return result;
//    }
//    e = Object.assign({}, e, g(e,a,'a'));
//    let h = [{}, e, a].reduce(g);


    //But that's not that important, as we'll see in a second.



    //We can generalize this as Object.combine(), which is the SimpatiCore combine method.
    //A Core is programmed as a sequence of handlers; it's tested as a non-linear sequence of WET + test observers;
    //It's used as a linear sequence of WET at one or more canonical durable (server) processes.

    //We can and should consider different data-structures, particularly shared data-structures that have
    //demonstrable value. Marketplaces. Social media platforms. We can think of a simple static site, which
    //is itself a sophisticated data-structure (a tree with every node itself a tree, but of a very different sort).
    //This is the file-system and it is HTML and while we have a fondness for static content, the fact is
    //that some see this as a lost opportunity for profit. It is possible to extract value from
    //consumers in a wide variety of ways. We can

    // A handler is a lovely object that is ultimately a function with some improvements. It has a string
    // name, and it's a pure function that takes an object, a context (or residue), and returns a list of objects.
    // By convention, if you call it with no arguments or incomplete arguments, it will return a
    // representation of validity with some fields being collapsed from pattern to value.

    //A string is the most general value, and the pattern is a list of predicates that monotonically
    //reduce the possible strings. JSON and scalar representations, all in strings.

    // Strive to express your application in text first. Model the domain in text, and get a feel for
    // the operations it must support. Operations, in Simpatico, are represented by Handlers. The
    // game in Simpatico is to define a useful World Event Tree; the programmer focuses on the Handlers
    // the users focus on steady state input.

    // Start with a root node representing the running application. The root node is a singleton object
    // that has an internal structure to support Handlers, Observers, and State, and that has enough of
    // these objects to produce a result. Handlers and state are related because state is mutated
    // during handler resolution (message cascade). Handlers can initialize the state they need.

    // The simplest representation is as a message list that, in a way that can most neatly expressed as a series
    // of reductions, produce a tree of residue

//    Object.prototype.combine = function(args...){
//
//    }
//
//    let e = Object.create(a);



    // Includes prototype
    for (let key in b){
      console.log('in', key, b[key]);
    }

    // Does not include prototype
    for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(b)){
      console.log('of', key, value);
    }

//    for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(b)){
//      console.log('of', key, value);
//    }
//
    Object.entries(b).forEach((entry,i)=>console.log('foreach', entry,i));
