<h1>About the Simpatico Shell</h1>
<p>Josh Rehman <i>2022</i></p>

<p>
  This document discusses the structure of the Simpatico Shell.
  The Shell is described completely by the <code>simpatico.io/index.html</code> resource and it's subresources.
  The Shell plus device creates a durable process.
  The Durable process is an authoring tool.
  It is also a tool used to navigate other people's tabs.
  The choices that went into making it.
  The paths not travelled (
    Why not markdown?
    Why so much SVG?
    Why no front-end build?
  )
  This resource is intended to be stable and cached by the browser for a long time.
  The resource describes the primordial starting point from which any software might start to form.
  So it's important to understand it.
</p>

<p>
  It is authored by hand in a style meant to be read in source.
  The structure is very line-oriented and attempts to put one value per line.
