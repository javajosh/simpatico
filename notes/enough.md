# Draft: The Philosophy of Enough

Capitalism is a powerful system of distributed resource allocation that, in its best light, gives the most people the most opportunity.
Capitalism's primary error mode is extreme concentration of wealth, a feature that is inherent as capital can be used to acquire more capital.

We need a cure that isn't worse than the disease.
I think we need to embrace capitalism, up to a point.
That is, maximize profit until you hit a certain point, then stop.
I call it the policy of "Enough".

Make the threshold generous, or even self-declared.
I don't think the ideology of capitalism suffers all that much from this adjustment.
Once you succeed to a certain point, you leave the game and enjoy your life.

Plus, we don't have to be too draconian about solutions.
For example, we can and should mandate that no new vehicles above a certain weight, and no new small jets, should be produced.
The ones in existence we leave alone, and let decay take its course.
The same with billionaires: leave them alone, and limit the next generation.

This idea is novel, as far as I know, and I think it could satisfy both hard-core capitalists AND environmentalists, which is a rare thing.
As for the right Enough number, I think for me it's about 10M 2023 USD.
And I'd like to get to a point in human history where everyone can get there.
