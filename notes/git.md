git is pretty straightforward on linux/ubuntu. use `apt` to install and update.

On Windows it is more complicated. [intellij](intellij.md) will use the Windows version, which you can install with chocolatey. But windows/wsl/ubuntu will use the `apt` installed version. Of particular interest to [oh my zsh](oh-my-zsh.md) users is that the linux git command is executed on every prompt.
