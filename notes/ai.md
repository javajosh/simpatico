ChatGPT 3.5 is cool, I've read that [4 is even cooler](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf).
Github Copilot is...uneven. But worth $10/mo.

One thing I'd like to do is get a model working locally.
My desktop has a beefy CPU and GPU, I think it could run one of these programs. But how to get it to run?

One lead is [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY). It's a long video (I'm still working through it) but he goes into the nuts and bolts of making ChatGPT from its constituent parts. It feels fluent to a non-python expert, although he does come in at a fairly high level - assuming knowledge of specific libraries, datasets, algorithms and datastructures.

Although I would have liked to see the non-combat areas stressed.
