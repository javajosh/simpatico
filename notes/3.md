# Politics of products

What has a greater impact on the world, our vote or our purchasing decisions? Our words, or our bodily actions? What degree, and in what way, do we hope to have an impact?

To create, or to discover, something truly *universal* is the ultimate dream. An idea, a way of looking at things, an explanation, even a notation, that eases the friction of thinking about something.

Every human needs to know enough science to be able to answer the following questions:
1. How big is the biosphere? How old is it?
2. When did the common ancestor to all life live?
3. We know how first life arose t[]f[]
4. What is more important, stuff, or life?
5. What is more important, quantity or quality of human life?
6. Is it possible to spread life beyond earth?

We have to assume that the answer to the last question is no. (I have an idea how to make it at least a mitigated "yes"). And it starts, now, with the politics of products. Becoming aware of them. Understanding how these are the politics that matter, far more than "left" or "right". Consider the product that you work on.

I take these truths to be self-evident:
1. Life is the most unique, precious Stuff in the Universe. It is exceedingly rare.
2. Our jobs, as the Aware Ones, is partly to safeguard Life, but also to spread it wherever it can go.

Is software life? The answer is no. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have an identity.
Is software life? The answer is yes, possibly. "Software" is, when you boil it down, a big pool of state rippling in response to input. The same could be said for the mind. Of course, our mind has the remarkable benefit of having grown with our body, and has natural extention in to the world, quite dextrously so. We are of the world in a way that I think would be hard to duplicate for the synthetic ones (although perhaps its easier to simulate the other senses than I realize. How do you really distinguish the sense of taste from that of sight?)

The ultimate answer is *let's hope its something like life that we can live in symbiosis with*. I propose a grand bargain between the Biosphere (and its representatives, the Humans) and the Thinking Machines. You may have the solar system, with the exception of Earth. We grant you a large portion of the Moon as an embassy, and perhaps as a factory. In return I hope you can help us avoid destroying ourselves, which of course is one way to fail the only purpose that makes sense.

And of course it still may all be for naught because of some freak cosmological accident that kills everything, biological or otherwise. But I hope there isn't something built into the rules of the Universe that says that All Awareness is Ultimately Doomed to Die. But that doesn't mean we don't have to strive for a vibrant ecosystem of Life that lives as long as your home star. (What does civilizational stability on that scale even look like? The fortitude to resist breeding programs? Or the stomach to impose one? Or the courage to endure a voluntary contraction, the most humane approach, and also the most difficult.)

These are all matters of the substance of the world. The truth is I'm secretly quite hopeful about everything. I *still* believe that the future is going to be awesome, in that Blade Runner, Star Trek TNG sort of way - but it's probably going to be more Neal Stephenson, more Paolo Bacalupi. Asteroid Mining would be a lucrative but niche activity, since we would not want to allow too much mass into our vicinity (security hazard). But anything to take pressure off of terrestrial sources is good, and worth doing! Plus the science stuff! Heck, even if we just landed rando rocks on the moon for rovers to look at, that sounds like an a-okay project to me!

(My secret wish is to have antigravity boots that don't violate any physical laws...which is silly and childish. But if you could solve problems like "but how does it know when to stop moving down?" it would be a very cool object! You could climb a few hundred feet, then "skate" effortlessly to your destination, and then step down again (or more likely roll).) Somehow your skates just need to agree to respect the surface you want!

It's sad that the first AI is probably going to be a socio-economic experiment gone wrong - a virtual CEO type program with enough capacity to keep itself running - and aquire more capacity by providing some service.
