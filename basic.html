<p>Please open this file in the developer tools, and press the start button. Then press reset as often as you like, and
    stop.
    Then hit start again.</p>

<p>This file is a variant of a very basic loop:</p>
<pre><code>
    function handle(event) {
        state = combine(state, event);
        render(state);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The idea behind this code is explored more fully in the readme. Here, the <code>render()</code> is just
    <code>console.log(state)</code>, and the event is just the number '6'. State is updated every 50ms.
</p>

<p>Another thought that has been on my mind is this: how far can you get on the modern web without resorting to
    build-tools? No modules, no linters, no bundlers, minifiers, no transpiled languages of any kind. Avoid libraries,
    both JS and CSS, but if added add by hand, and serve from the origin host (no CDN). On the plus side,
    you can assume only modern browsers, which means modern tools like ES6, CSS3, and HTML5, and all the modern
    DOM API features you could ever want. How far can you get? What would your code look like?

<script>
  // State is reassigned on every handle() call, so it can't be a const.
  // This approach will, in general, put pressure on the garbage collector.
  let state = {};

  // One reduction per key; residue is a synonym for "accumulator" here
  const reducers = {
    // These reducers are good for numbers
    adder: (residue = 0, event) => residue + event,
    multiplier: (residue = 1, event) => residue * event,
    divider: (residue = 1e30, event) => residue / event,

    // This one is good for any type
    rememberer: (residue = [], event) => {
      const result = residue.slice();
      result.push(event);
      return result;
    }
  }

  // Reduce every member of residue, key-wise. Note that this only works because
  // all reductions are over compatible data-structures, in this case, integers.
  const bigReduce = (reducers, residue, event) => {
    const result = {};
    for (let key in reducers) {
      result[key] = reducers[key](residue[key], event);
    }
    return result;
  }

  // Here, the combine function applies big reduce to global state.
  const combine = (state, event) => bigReduce(reducers, state, event);
  // Render to the console (this is the simplest renderer).
  const render = (state) => {
    console.log(state)
  };

  // This is the main entry-point of the application, unchanged from application to application.
  // In a very real sense the combine and render are paramterized, and set by closure, in this case.
  const handle = (event) => {
    state = combine(state, event);
    render(state);
  }

  // Controls are simply global functions we can call from the console or directly from the DOM.
  let timerId;
  const start = () => timerId = setInterval(() => handle(6), 50);
  const stop = () => clearInterval(timerId || 0);
  const reset = () => state = {};

  // The window itself is a source of events.
  const windowSize = () => ({width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight})
  const resize = e => console.log({...windowSize(),t: e.timeStamp});
  window.onresize = resize;
