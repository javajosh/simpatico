Make something that works, but is stupid, unoriginal, and uninspiring.

A website is nothing more than a process bound to port 80 and a tree of text files. The choices you make to get to that point are assumed. But it is a path that starts with you buying hardware, installing an operating system, developer tools, and writing your own software. Or if you are bold and/or lazy, downloading the software other people have written.

(The bootstrap hardware and software people need to get on the network is itself an interesting topic! Personally, I prefer my 2013 MBPr, with macOS 10.15.17 (Catalina), which itself is based on FreeBSD, most importantly, its tcp/ip stack, process and user systems.)

Your space to edit, should also be your space to publish. Publish this note, [now](https://github.com/javajosh/simpatico/blob/master/1.md)!

Convenient, but with serious drawbacks. In particular Microsoft/github owns the page, not you. So, publish this in github pages now! You only get one repository per user account, looks like. In my case, javajosh.github.io. (Which redirects to javajosh.com).

 Earlier I installed [google-java-format](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527-google-java-format) in IntelliJ on emil.

So the first layer of indirection is a "droplet" at Digital Ocean. It is a server running as a single process, interactive and complete, with limited RAM, disk, network, and variable CPU capacity. Importantly, it does get an IPv4 address so it can get a TLS cert and function as a real world server.

Note that the IP addressed assigned by DO should be synchronized with NameCheap. Note the asymmetry: one name, but potentially many running instances, most of them dormant. The indirection of name and ip address is often exploited for host-level load balancing. This is slightly different than responding to mem/disk/cpu pressure with either a request for more resources for *this* process (which is neat, but dynamic infra like this is out of favor these days), or a request for another process to share the load (definitely in favor these days).

The Request is the smallest unit of work. A Request gets a Response. Note that if things go unexpectedly wrong, the "Response" might never come, or be an error code instead of a normal, navigable response.

The information bias for a server is always "inward" toward the server center. Servers want input. They, in turn, tantalize users into giving it to them, often by combining all that input into something greater than the sum of its parts (social media and search). Note: there is no judgement here; I think the inward bias is universal, cannot be avoided and has significant upside.

A host can be referred to by its IP address or DNS name. A process on that host can be addressed with a port number. Alternatively, processes can be addressed through a web API that maps a URL path to a port.
