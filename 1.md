Make something that works, but is stupid, unoriginal, and uninspiring.

A website is nothing more than a process bound to port 80 and a tree of text files. The choices you make to get to that point are assumed. But it is a path that starts with you buying hardware, installing an operating system, developer tools, and writing your own software. Or if you are bold and/or lazy, downloading the software other people have written.

(The bootstrap hardware and software people need to get on the network is itself an interesting topic! Personally, I prefer my 2013 MBPr, with macOS 10.15.17 (Catalina), which itself is based on FreeBSD, most importantly, its tcp/ip stack, process and user systems.)
