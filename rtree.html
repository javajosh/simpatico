<h2>The Problem of State Management</h2>

<p>The problem of process state management is currently tackled by software components like Redux.</p>

<p>Note that server side software doesn't have state; or rather, it's state is a very tightly coupled to the static
  source code. That type of code is dominated by the definition of singletons (and the reuse of them), to support, ultimately, Controllers that do the work. In general, a server must be responsible for its own security.
</p>

  <p>These singletons recapitulate
  many of the same concerns that arise in build systems; in fact its the same concern but handled at compile time by one
  tool (Maven) and at runtime by another tool (Spring). Or on the client by one tool at compile-time (npm, ng) and
  another at runtime (angular module annotations). </p>

<p>The natural data-structure then would be to model state as a special dynamic part of the head of a linked list of
  input. It doesn't really have to be dynamic. </p>

<p>Well, it's a kind of tree that is built up in a particular way. It's a constrained kind of n-arry tree, which is
  optimized for long runs. We imagine the tree composed of rows, and each row has a parent, rather than each node.
  Moreover, we introduce a special coordinate system that supports rows and nodes as parents, and provide a (stateful)
  pointer to the target. The rule is that if you're pointing at a node, you create a new row with that as it's parent.
  Otherwise, you're just adding to the row.</p>
