	<h1>Rehman Tree</h1>
	<p>Josh Rehman <i>20 Jan 2019</i></p>
	<p>Not super happy with this right now in a few ways:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The tests are bad - very few assertions. Need to add more specific path stuff</li>
		<li>The implementation uses references and (new) objects around everything. I'm not sure if I olke that. I sort of liked my array-based index-based API from before, and it certaily serializes better, and potentially saves a lot of space when there are long runs on the same branch.</li>
		<li>I can't help but think I'm missing something very elegant - my previous "offset" solution was actually rather elegant, after all.</li>
		<li>I am, however, totally happy that this data-structure is totally independent of <code>combine()</code> - it really is different. Eventually there will be a cool data-structure associated with the tips, but that's strictly a composite data-structure</li>
		<li>I still want to get clever with the coordinate system, using positive numbers for node parents and negative for branch parents, for example.</li>
		<li>I don't mind the statefulness of the tipIndex. I thought i would, but I don't.</li>
	</ol>

		let r = rtree();
		deepEquals(r.tip(), {parent:null, val:null});

		// Without a parent argument, each value is set to the previous value
		r.add(1); r.add(2); r.add(3); r.add(4);
		arr(r.nodes);
		assertEquals(5, r.nodes.length);

		// If we store a reference to the node, we can later add nodes to it.
		r = rtree(0);
		let n = r.add(1);
		r.add(2);
		r.add(3, n);
		n = r.add(4, n);

		let path = r.path(n).map(n => n.val);

		log('tests succeeded!');
